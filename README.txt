This project was written in Java but created using the Processing Software IDE.

Currently there are no interactions between the elements other than basic 2 dimensional physics, i.e. oil does not light on fire but sand will still cascade off steel differently than water would.  

To run, download the Processing IDE from https://processing.org/download/ and open the FallingSandSimulation.pde file in this folder.
